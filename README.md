Spontaneous Entropy Increase as Causality



# 3.1 Definition
The entropy formulation S=∏ m ᵢ (i∈ ℕ) operates fundamentally at the SEQ level while enabling coarse-graining for arbitrary massive many-body systems. This universality stems from energy-mass equivalence, allowing the cumulative product to inherently encode multi-body interactions. The formulation imposes first-principles computational constraints for discrete simulations across all scales.

# 3.2 Properties
This definition conserves energy, exhibits an entropy ceiling, ensures spontaneous increase, and logarithmically aligns with classical entropy. It establishes a novel analytic quantum thermodynamic framework. Coarse-graining automatically enforces microscopic particle indistinguishability in physical properties while characterizing the entropy-increasing process of energy homogenization.

# 3.3 Spontaneous Entropy Increase as Causality
The spontaneous entropy increase directly represents causality. A clear mapping exists: one space transformation corresponds to one entropy value, which further corresponds to one possible moment.

# 3.4 Space-Time-Entropy Mapping
The relationship between space, time, and entropy is defined as follows:

Space transformation → Entropy value
Entropy value → Possible moment
This mapping underpins the thermodynamic and causal structure of the model.

# 3.5 Validation
The conservation laws, entropy ceiling, and alignment with classical thermodynamics collectively validate the definition. The model's ability to describe frequency modulation as an essential aspect of spatial deformation further confirms its analytic robustness.

## Computable Analytic Entropy: Advantages Over Traditional Statistical Entropy

 Multiplicative analytic entropy (S=∏ᵢ mᵢ) explicitly encodes each step of energy homogenization within a system. Unlike traditional statistical entropy (S∝ln Ω), which only captures macroscopic state differences through logarithmic counting of microstates, the multiplicative formulation preserves microscopic transition details via cumulative product operations. This allows direct tracking of irreversible energy redistribution dynamics, where every incremental increase in entropy corresponds to a quantifiable step toward equilibrium—naturally embedding time asymmetry without ad hoc assumptions about low-entropy initial conditions.

 At Planck-scale (tₚ) resolutions, multiplicative entropy reveals deterministic characteristics of physical states, bridging quantum fluctuations with macroscopic thermodynamics. Traditional statistical entropy, limited to ensemble averages, cannot resolve such fine-grained dynamics or transient entropy production during short-timescale interactions. The analytic foundation of multiplicative entropy unifies deterministic Planck-scale behavior with emergent statistical phenomena, offering a physically intuitive framework where entropy generation directly mirrors energy dispersal processes.

## Key advantages include:

Process granularity – Product sequences (∏ᵢ mᵢ) record intermediate energy transfers, while statistical entropy erases transitional details by aggregating states into Ω.

Time asymmetry – Entropy increase inherently reflects irreversible dynamics, eliminating reliance on probabilistic postulates like molecular chaos.

Scale compatibility – Resolves both quantum fluctuations (tₚ-scale) and classical homogenization, unlike statistical entropy’s coarse-grained ensemble limitations.

This approach transforms entropy from a statistical measure into an analytic tool for modeling causality and energy flow across all physical scales.
